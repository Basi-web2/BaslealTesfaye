      <h1>About me</h1> 
      <p>
          Summer day in July brought my birth on the 24th of 1999 in Ethiopia where I currently reside. From the time I can remember football has been my deep love and I reside in Ethiopia. I have always appreciated all facets of football since my childhood years including its thrill combined with its athletic abilities and its vigorous nature. My ultimate goal in life involves striving to become a professional football player with ambitions to make my name known throughout the sport.

Football exists as an essential part in my life since I devote all my being to it. Football matches remain at the top of my preferred activities. An international championship game alongside community football matches both captivate me during the entire contest. What I love about football is studying various playing techniques together with strategy evaluation and learning lessons from world-class players.

By dedicating myself to hard work I feel confident that I will achieve my dream. I live by football yet this sport represents much greater than mere competition for me.
