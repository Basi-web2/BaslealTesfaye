      <h1>About me</h1> 
      <p>
        My name is Basleal Tesfaye, and I was born on July 24, 1999. I live in Ethiopia, and football has been my passion for as long as I can remember. Ever since I was a kid, I’ve loved everything about the game—the excitement, the skill, and the energy it brings. My biggest dream is to become a professional football player and make a name for myself in the sport.

Football isn’t just something I play; it’s something I live and breathe. Watching football is one of my favorite things to do. Whether it’s a big international match or just a local game, I enjoy every moment of it. I love studying different playing styles, analyzing strategies, and learning from the best players in the world.

I believe that with hard work, dedication, and perseverance, I can turn my dream into reality. Football is more than just a game to me—it’s a passion that drives me every single day.
